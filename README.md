#BL8064

Hi and welcome to the protein structure prediction exercise for the course [Methods in Molecular Life Science](https://www.su.se/english/search-courses-and-programmes/bl8064-1.684212).
This exercise is about assessing the impact of mutations using protein structure prediction.
\
Did you know that proteins interact to form intricate signaling networks?
If mutations occur in the interaction interfaces - these networks can be perturbed resulting in functional changes!
\
Here we will assess the impact of mutations of **your choice** on proteins of **your choice** using protein structure prediction of interaction networks.
